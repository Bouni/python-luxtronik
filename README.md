# luxtronik

python-luxtronik is a Python library that allows you to interact with a
Luxtronik heat pump controller programmatically. This enables you to read
values from the heat pump and write values back to the heat pump, thus
influencing its behaviour.

## BACKGROUND

Luxtronik is a heat pump control system developed by Alpha Innotec that is used
by several manufactures. Essentially it is the part of the heat pump system
that the user can interact with locally via display and setting dial.

This library uses a TCP socket that is exposed via network (typically on port
8889). Values can be read from and written to the heat pump, essentially making
it controllable from within a Python program.

This allows you, for example, to change the temperature settings of your heat
pump or get current temperature values from the heat pump, similar to what you
can do when controlling the heat pump locally on-site.

This TCP socket is meant to be used by the vendor to control the heat pump
via various mobile apps and desktop applications.

Unfortunately there is no official documentation of this API, and how to
interact with it. As such, the **implementation is heavily based on reverse
engineering**.

## INSTALLATION

This library can be installed via pip by issuing the following command:

```shell
pip install luxtronik
```

Afterwards the module can be used like any other Python module, i.e. it can
be imported via `import luxtronik` from your Python scripts.

## DOCUMENTATION

There is no automatically rendered documentation of this library available yet,
so you'll have to fall back to using the source code itself as documentation. It
can be found in the [luxtronik](luxtronik/) directory.

## EXAMPLE USAGE

### READING VALUES FROM THE HEAT PUMP

The following example reads in data from the heat pump:

```python
from luxtronik import Luxtronik

l = Luxtronik('192.168.1.23', 8889)
calculations, parameters, visibilities = l.read()

t_forerun = calculations.get("ID_WEB_Temperatur_TVL")

# alternatively get also works with numerical ID values

t_forerun = calculations.get(10)

print(t_forerun) # this returns the temperature value of the forerun, 22.7 for example
print(t_forerun.unit) # gives you the unit of the value if known, °C for example

# calculations holds measurement values
# check https://github.com/Bouni/luxtronik/blob/master/luxtronik/calculations.py for values you might need

# parameters holds parameter values
# check https://github.com/Bouni/luxtronik/blob/master/luxtronik/parameters.py for values you might need

# visibilitys holds visibility values, the function of visibilities is not clear at this point
# check https://github.com/Bouni/luxtronik/blob/master/luxtronik/visibilities.py for values you might need
```

### SCRIPTS AND COMMAND LINE INTERFACE (CLI)

Once installed, the luxtronik package provides several scripts that can be used
to interact with your heatpump. Those scripts can be invoked like regular
commands from the command line.

### DISCOVERY OF AVAILABLE HEATPUMPS WITHIN THE NETWORK

Heat pumps can be discovered in a network by sending broadcast packages that the
Luxtronik controller will reply to. This can be done with the `discover`
sub command in the following way:

```sh
luxtronik discover
```

```sh
1 heatpump(s) reported back                                                                                                                                                                                      │
Heat pump #0 -> IP address: 192.168.178.123 port: 8889
```

### DUMP ALL DATA

To get all data available you can either use the CLI:

```sh
luxtronik dump 192.168.178.123 8889
```

or call the script that comes with the python package:

```python
PYTHONPATH=. ./scripts/dump_luxtronik.py 192.168.178.123 8889
```

The output of this script can be used to backup all values (e.g. before
modifying them) and to get a better understanding about parameters (e.g. by
looking for differences when comparing the output after doing some changes
locally, etc.).

You'll get a long list of all data, like this (truncated):

```

### SHOW CHANGED VALUES ONLY

There is another sub-command (`changes`) and/or script (`dump-changes.py`) that
will only show values that have recently changed. This is meant to be used
interactively, i.e. the current value of specific settings will be shown.
This is especially useful to identify yet unknown parameters.
You can closely monitor the output while changing values on the Luxtronik
controller itself.

This can be invoked in the following ways:

```sh
luxtronik changes 192.168.178.123 8889
```

Alternatively, it can be invoked directly:

```python
PYTHONPATH=. ./scripts/dump_changes.py 192.168.178.123 8889
```

You'll get a list of all values as they change:

### WRITING VALUES TO HEAT PUMP

The following example writes data to the heat pump:

```python
from luxtronik import Luxtronik, Parameters

l = Luxtronik('192.168.1.23', 8889)

parameters = Parameters()
heating_mode = parameters.set("ID_Ba_Hz_akt", "Party")
l.write(parameters)

# If you're not sure what values to write, you can get all available options:

print(parameters.get("ID_Ba_Hz_akt").options()) # returns a list of possible values to write, ['Automatic', 'Second heatsource', 'Party', 'Holidays', 'Off'] for example
```

**NOTE:** Writing values to the heat pump is particulary dangerous as this is
an undocumented API. By default a safe guard is in place, which will prevent
writing parameters that are not (yet) understood.

You can disable that safeguard by passing `safe=False` to the Luxtronik class
during initialization:

```python
from luxtronik import Luxtronik

l = Luxtronik('192.168.1.23', 8889, safe=False)
```

**NOTE:** The heat pump controller uses a NAND memory chip as persistent storage.
This technology has only a limited number of erase cycles.
Every change of a parameter will eventually induce some file changes on the controller,
hence **frequent parameter changes may limit the lifetime of your heat pump**.

## CONTRIBUTION

The source code is maintained using git and lives in a dedicated
[GitHub repository][github-repo].

Contributions are, of course, highly welcome.

Besides providing improvements to the code itself, there is also help needed in
other areas, in particular the documentation as well as understanding the
parameters that are provided by the heat pump. Also reporting bugs and/or
submitting feature requests via the [issue tracker][issue-tracker] is helpful.

The fastest way to provide improvements to the code is is to use
[pull requests][pull-request-doc].

The use of [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is highly recommended in
order to keep the quality of your contribution as high as possible.

After cloning this repository, change directory (`cd`) into it and simply type
`pre-commit` in order to install the pre-commit hooks.

For that to work you need python (which you most likely already have installed)
and the `pre-commit` package. If not already installed you can install it with
`pip install -U pre-commit`. Furthermore you need a recent version of `nodejs`
on your system because some of the hooks are based on JavaScript / Node.js.
